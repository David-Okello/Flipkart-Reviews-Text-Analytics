# **Flipkart Reviews Text Analytics**

A step-by-step Text Analytics project on Flipkart product reviews, culminating in insights mapped to Porter‚Äôs Five Forces. Includes:

- Data cleaning & preprocessing
- Exploratory data analysis (EDA)
- Sentiment classification (TensorFlow)
- Topic modeling (LDA via Gensim)
- Strategic insights and report

## **Assignment Overview**  
> _From SCS3312 Text Analytics Practicum Assignment III_ (submitted 29 Apr 2025; due 15 May 2025) 

> **Porter‚Äôs Five Forces:**  
> 1. Threat of New Entrants  
> 2. Bargaining Power of Suppliers  
> 3. Bargaining Power of Buyers  
> 4. Threat of Substitutes  
> 5. Rivalry Among Competitors  
>
> Using a secondary review dataset (e.g., Flipkart Product Reviews), you must:
> - **Describe a pipeline** from Data Collection ‚Üí Insight Generation (with TF code snippets).  
> - **Sentiment Analysis** for Buyer Power: detect negative sentiment on price, missing features or poor service (include code & screenshots).  
> - **Topic Modeling** to surface mentions of new entrants, competitors, disruptive tech, substitutes, pain points (include code & screenshots).
>
> *Answer ALL questions in your report and notebook.*
